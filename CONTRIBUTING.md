# Contributing to Credit-Chain

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- Governance context is single + locked
- No redesigns without explicit directive
- Additive-first changes only

## Dev Flow
- npm install
- npm run dev
- ZIP-based patches applied sequentially

## Style
- Prefer small helpers in src/lib
- Avoid side effects on import
