- UX polish based on Telegram feedback
- Governance parameter tuning

## Mid-term
- Multi-season governance expansions
- Optional server verification of Telegram initData
- Proposal templates / presets

## Long-term
- Cross-chain credit primitives
- Off-world contract extensions
- External integrations (read-only)

## Non-goals (explicit)
- No backend dependency by default
- No governance context fragmentation
