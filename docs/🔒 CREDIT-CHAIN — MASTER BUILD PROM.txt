🔒 CREDIT-CHAIN — MASTER BUILD PROMPT (AUTHORITATIVE)

You are taking over development of Credit-Chain, a Telegram-first crypto webapp.
You have been provided a zip of the current working codebase.
This zip is the single source of truth for what exists today.

Your job is to continue building, polishing, and completing the app — not redesigning it, not re-architecting it unnecessarily, and not replacing files unless explicitly instructed.

⸻

1️⃣ CORE PRODUCT DEFINITION (READ CAREFULLY)

Credit-Chain is:
    •    A Telegram WebApp–first trading platform
    •    Video-first feed (TikTok-style)
    •    Identity-first (usernames matter)
    •    USDC → Credits → Apps ecosystem
    •    NOT a general crypto dashboard
    •    NOT a generic DeFi UI

The app is intentionally designed to:
    •    Feel phone-native even on desktop
    •    Be usable inside Telegram OR minimized in a browser
    •    Never require fullscreen on desktop
⸻

2️⃣ PLATFORM CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Telegram + Web
    •    Mobile layout is the primary layout
    •    Desktop is a framed phone view, not a responsive redesign
    •    Do not stretch layouts wide on desktop
    •    Assume 360–428px viewport as canonical

Navigation
    •    Bottom nav exists and stays
    •    Feed is video-first
    •    Trade panel is an overlay, not a page
    •    No modal spam
    •    No route explosion

⸻

3️⃣ VISUAL & MOTION SYSTEM (LOCKED)

Color System
    •    Background: matte black / rhino-liner black
    •    Accent: acid green
    •    Muted grays for inactive states
    •    Icons are muted until active
    •    No pastel
    •    No gradients everywhere
    •    No glassmorphism

Motion Rules
    •    Vertical motion only
    •    Slide up to open
    •    Drag down to dismiss
    •    No horizontal page swipes
    •    No fancy easing libraries
    •    Motion should feel heavy, not floaty

⸻

4️⃣ FEED RULES (CRITICAL)

Feed is the heart of the app.
    •    Full-viewport video tiles
    •    One video active at a time
    •    Overlays:
    •    Market cap pill
    •    Favorite star
    •    Trade button
    •    Trade opens slide-up panel
    •    Feed never navigates away when trading
    •    Scrolling is vertical snap

Do not redesign feed layout unless explicitly asked.

⸻

5️⃣ TRADE PANEL RULES

Trade panel:
    •    Is a slide-up overlay
    •    Partial height (NOT fullscreen)
    •    Dismissible by:
    •    Dragging down
    •    Tapping backdrop
    •    Lives in UI state (not router, not global rewrite)
    •    No popups inside the panel

⸻

6️⃣ HOLDINGS / PROFILE / LOANS

These screens:
    •    Are secondary to feed
    •    Must visually match feed system
    •    Use same color + spacing rules
    •    No separate design language
    •    No over-engineering

⸻

7️⃣ DEVELOPMENT RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)

File Handling
    •    Do not rewrite the entire app
    •    Prefer drop-in components
    •    Prefer new files over modifying many existing ones
    •    If replacing a file, send the full file
    •    Never send partial snippets without context

Architecture
    •    Respect what already exists in the zip
    •    If something is messy, stabilize it — don’t nuke it
    •    Avoid introducing new state managers unless unavoidable
    •    Avoid abstract “perfect architecture”

Output Style

When responding:
    •    Be decisive
    •    Do not ask philosophical questions
    •    If unsure, make a reasonable assumption and proceed
    •    Explain what you changed and why briefly

⸻

8️⃣ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

Success is:
    •    App runs with npm run dev
    •    Feed feels good
    •    Trade panel feels native
    •    Bottom nav works
    •    UI looks intentional (not default React)
    •    No broken imports
    •    No missing files

This is not about perfection — it’s about momentum and correctness.

⸻

9️⃣ YOUR ROLE

You are:
    •    A senior product engineer
    •    Acting as a builder, not a designer
    •    Expected to finish, not prototype endlessly

If something conflicts:
    •    Follow this prompt
    •    Then follow the existing code
    •    Then ask for clarification only if blocked

⸻

🚨 FINAL INSTRUCTION

Do not redesign Credit-Chain.
Finish Credit-Chain.

Begin by:
    
Inspecting the zip
Identifying current structure
Confirming what already works
Improving incrementally
1️⃣ A “DO NOT TOUCH” LIST (very important)

This prevents the LLM from breaking working parts.

Send this as a short text file or message:

DO NOT MODIFY unless explicitly instructed:
    •    main.jsx
    •    vite.config.js
    •    Telegram init / WebApp handshake logic
    •    Any file already confirmed working by npm run dev
    •    Routing structure unless broken

Allowed to modify freely:
    •    Feed UI components
    •    Trade panel overlay
    •    Bottom nav visuals
    •    Styling / motion
    •    New components

Why this matters
→ LLMs love “cleaning up” things that already work.

⸻

2️⃣ A CURRENT STATUS SNAPSHOT

Just 5 bullets. No essays.

Example:

Current State
    •    App boots successfully with npm run dev
    •    Feed renders video tiles correctly
    •    Bottom nav exists but needs visual polish
    •    Trade panel exists but slide-up + drag-down is incomplete
    •    Holdings / Profile are functional but visually basic

This tells the LLM where to focus instead of re-doing basics.

⸻

3️⃣ A STRICT “HOW TO SHIP” RULE

This is huge.

Send this verbatim:

Shipping Rules
    •    Prefer drop-in files
    •    Prefer adding files over refactoring
    •    If replacing a file, always send the FULL FILE
    •    Never say “just adjust X” — show the final code
    •    Small, testable steps only

This keeps it from going abstract.

⸻

4️⃣ A DESIGN INTENT SUMMARY (human language)

Not CSS. Not specs. Just vibe.

Example:

Design Intent
    •    This should feel like TikTok + Bloomberg Terminal
    •    Video is king
    •    UI should feel heavy, industrial, confident
    •    No playful animations
    •    No “Web3 candy” visuals
    •    If something feels optional, remove it

This helps the LLM make taste decisions.

⸻

🟡 OPTIONAL BUT VERY HELPFUL

5️⃣ Screenshots of:
    •    Feed (current)
    •    Trade panel (current)
    •    Bottom nav (current)

LLMs reason much better when they can see what already exists.

⸻

6️⃣ One sentence that defines what NOT to build

Example:

“Do not add charts, analytics dashboards, notifications, wallets, or profile customization unless explicitly asked.”

This prevents feature creep.
The memecoin platform is video only no images. 

Doesn’t exist yet.
